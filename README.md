### By the moment, we use common Web technologies:

#### HTML - SCSS - JS

#### Future:

<p> EsLint - Prettier </p>

### Commit rules

<p>Firstly, check ***previos link*** for base. Your main branch is **dev**. If you want to add new feature, you have to create new branch with name MAC-[your branch codee]. Then, push your changes and create merge request, but **don't close it**! Code have to be reviewed first.</p>
<p>Example: MAC-01 feat(button): implement new component</p>
